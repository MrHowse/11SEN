# Topic 2: The Object-Oriented Paradigm

## Understanding OOP

### Apply the key features of an object-oriented programming (OOP) language

- **Objects**
  - Basic units of OOP.
  - Represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviours (methods).

- **Classes**
  - Blueprints for creating objects.
  - Define attributes and methods.

- **Encapsulation**
  - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class).
  - Restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

- **Abstraction**
  - Simplifying complex reality by modelling classes appropriate to the problem.
  - Hiding unnecessary details from the user.

- **Inheritance**
  - Mechanism to create new classes using existing classes.
  - Promotes code reusability.

- **Generalisation**
  - Abstracting common characteristics into a base class.
  - Used to manage complexity and enhance code reusability.

- **Polymorphism**
  - Ability of different classes to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways.
  - Promotes flexibility in code.

### Compare procedural programming with OOP

- Procedural Programming: Focuses on functions or procedures to operate on data.
- OOP: Organises software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

### Use data flow diagrams, structure charts, and class diagrams to represent a system

- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**
  - Visual representation of data movement within a system.
  
- **Structure Charts**
  - Hierarchical diagrams showing system components and their interactions.
  
- **Class Diagrams**
  - Depict classes, attributes, methods, and relationships among objects.

### Describe the process of design used to develop code in an OOP language

- **Task Definition**
  - Clearly defining the problem and scope of the solution.

- **Top-down and Bottom-up**
  - Top-down: Breaking down the system into smaller parts.
  - Bottom-up: Building system components first and then integrating them.

- **Facade Pattern**
  - Simplifying complex systems by providing a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

- **Agility**
  - Implementing practices that promote adaptive planning and rapid delivery.

### Assess the effectiveness of programming code developed to implement an algorithm

- Evaluating the performance, readability, and maintainability of code.
- Ensuring the algorithm meets its intended purpose efficiently.

### Investigate how OOP languages handle message-passing between objects

- Objects communicate by sending and receiving information to each other through methods.
- Message-passing allows for interaction between objects to perform tasks.

### Explain code optimisation in software engineering

- Improving code to make it run more efficiently.
- Techniques include reducing redundancy, enhancing speed, and decreasing memory usage.

### Outline the features of OOP that support collaborative code development

- **Consistency**
  - Maintaining uniform coding standards.

- **Code Commenting**
  - Writing clear comments to explain code functionality.

- **Version Control**
  - Using tools like Git to manage changes and collaboration.

- **Feedback**
  - Regular code reviews and constructive feedback sessions.

## Programming in OOP

### Design and implement computer programs involving branching, iteration, and functions in an OOP language for an identified need or opportunity

- **Branching**
  - Using conditionals (if-else statements) to make decisions in code.

- **Iteration**
  - Implementing loops (for, while) to repeat actions.

- **Functions**
  - Writing reusable code blocks (methods) to perform specific tasks.

### Implement and modify OOP programming code

- **Clear and Uncluttered Mainline**
  - Keeping the main program logic straightforward and easy to follow.

- **One Logical Task per Subroutine**
  - Ensuring each method or function performs a single task.

- **Use of Stubs**
  - Creating placeholders for incomplete methods to test parts of the program.

- **Use of Control Structures and Data Structures**
  - Implementing appropriate structures to control flow and manage data efficiently.

- **Ease of Maintenance**
  - Writing code that is easy to update and debug.

- **Version Control**
  - Tracking changes and collaborating using systems like Git.

- **Regular Backup**
  - Maintaining up-to-date backups to prevent data loss.

### Apply methodologies to test and evaluate code

- **Unit, Subsystem, and System Testing**
  - Testing individual components, integrated subsystems, and the entire system.

- **Black, White, and Grey Box Testing**
  - Black Box: Testing without knowledge of internal implementation.
  - White Box: Testing with full visibility of code and logic.
  - Grey Box: Combination of both, with partial knowledge of internal structures.

- **Quality Assurance**
  - Ensuring the software meets specified standards and performs reliably.
